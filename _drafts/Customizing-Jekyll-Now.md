The Jekyll Now project has a great to-do list of items that can be customized right away. It is worth going through to understand all of the changes that can be made. However, on top of that, there are some additions that we've made to really make websites pop.

First, we add the ``` jekyll-paginate ``` plugin. This is one of the few plugins that GitHub allows, but it is an absolute requirement for any website that is going to have more than a couple posts. We assume that all websites will eventually need it, so why not enable it from the get-go.
