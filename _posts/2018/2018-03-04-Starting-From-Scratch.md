Starting from a blank Windows 10 laptop, this is how I go about creating a secure, robust website. Many of the steps below only have to be done the first time through (installing Visual Studio Code, creating a Github account, etc., but these steps are what we use to quickly get _something_ in front of a client. It is also how this website was originally built.

1. Create Github Account
1. Create Github Organization Account
1. Fork Jekyll Now
1. Install Visual Studio Code
1. Configure git (credential manager)
1. Clone, mirror, check-in githubpages.io
1. Register Domain
1. Create Cloudflare Account
1. Configure githubpages.io
1. Configure DNS, HTTPS, HSTS, etc.
1. Install Jekyll in Visual Studio Code

1. Test website with _jekyll serve_
