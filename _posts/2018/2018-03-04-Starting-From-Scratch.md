Starting from a blank Windows 10 laptop, this is how I go about creating a secure, robust website. Many of the steps below only have to be done the first time through (installing Visual Studio Code, creating a Github account, etc., but these steps are what we use to quickly get _something_ in front of a client. It is also how this website was originally built.

1. Create Github and Github Organization Accounts
  1. Github makes signing up incredibly easy. Go to [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join?return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Forganizations%2Fnew&source=login) and create an account.
  1. Create an Organization Account - I recommend doing this so you can easily transfer it to someone else in the future, add other collaborators, and generally get more features than if it was just a personal account. ![Github - New Organization]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/github-add-new.png)
